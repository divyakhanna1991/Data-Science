# Read the CSV file "california_housing_train.csv" into a DataFrame named df
df = pd.read_csv("california_housing_train.csv")

# Print the mean of each column in the DataFrame df
print(df.mean())

# Print a separator line for clarity
print("---------------------------")

# Create a new DataFrame df2 by selecting rows from 1 to 9 with a step of 2 (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
df2 = df.loc[1:9:2]

# Print the mean of each column in the DataFrame df2
